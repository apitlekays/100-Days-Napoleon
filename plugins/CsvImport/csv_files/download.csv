Here, wearing laurels, military uniform and an imperial cape, yet with his right arm curiously sleeveless and a crudely fashioned sandal on his left foot, the fallen warrior is shown with a bandage on his left ankle, a bleeding wound clearly displayed on the corresponding calf, in the act of claiming a white bird from the branch of a nearby tree in which a snake can be seen lurking within the foliage. The bow and quiver of arrows implies that the bird, possibly a white stork, symbolic of peace, has recently been shot by this composite figure. The detail of the rolled-up sleeve together with the print’s subtitle, N’a jamais passé la Manche, meaning either “always sleeveless” or “never crossed the English channel,” could be read as a sly commentary on the Emperor’s failure to fulfil his historical destiny. The derogatory use of “Nicolas” in the title, which recalls the chants of the crowds in Avignon as Napoleon made his way to Fréjus (“A bas Nicolas! A bas le tyran, le coquin, l’assassin des Français, le mauvais gueux!”), serves also to deflate the comparison between the Corsican usurper and the ancient Greek hero.","Bibliothèque nationale de France","25/11/2014","No precise date of publication","(optional) add any further information here to create an additional page.

The regiment had marched hard for two days and had come up later to take up position at the left centre of Wellington’s line. Exposed to small arms and ordnance fire, it took severe punishment, suffering 478 0f 698 casualties (68%). Its dead were observed lying in square after the action. There exists, on the battlefield, a memorial to this brave battalion.
Captain Holmes was struck in the back of his upper chest. The small lead ball had entered his thorax and caused death by bleeding and air leak. His wife, as a momento mori, had his body macerated and the damaged bone extracted, dried and varnished. It was set in silver and a display of arms and the word ‘Waterloo’ inscribed on its lid. Set in a red Moroccan leather case, the bone is missing a pedicle, which would have articulated with his second rib. The missile is contained in the case.
Perhaps a somewhat macabre souvenir of her husband and the battle, it must remain as one of the strangest artefacts of this important event.","Waterloo","01/07/1815","have date of death but not the date the memento mori created","(optional) add any further information here to create an additional page.
