## About the project

Everyone has heard of Waterloo. Less well-known is that Napoleon had already 
been defeated in 1814, but escaped his exile on Elba in February 1815, swept 
across France gathering troops, and toppled the newly restored Bourbon 
monarchy in Paris without firing a shot. Only then was he defeated by Wellington 
in June 1815, finally surrendering in July. Dad by day, this website releases an 
object that sheds light on these dramatic events, along with weekly summaries 
sketching out the period as a whole.
